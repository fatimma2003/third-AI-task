## third-AI-task
An AI-powered voice interaction system that converts Arabic speech to text using Whisper, generates smart replies with Cohere, and speaks the response using gTTS — all within Google Colab.

## Voice-to-Intelligent-Response Project

This project uses AI tools to convert spoken audio input into intelligent text responses, and then back into speech. It demonstrates a simple voice-based conversational system using modern AI models.


## Technologies Used

- Whisper by OpenAI – for automatic speech recognition (ASR).
- Cohere API – for generating smart, contextual text replies.
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) – for converting text responses back into audio.
- Google Colab – for running and sharing the notebook in the cloud.


## How It Works

1. Upload a voice file (MP3, WAV, etc.).
2. The voice is transcribed into text using Whisper.
3. The transcribed text is sent to Cohere to generate a relevant reply.
4. The reply is then converted to speech using gTTS and played back.


## How to Use

1. Open the Google Colab notebook.
2. Upload your audio file.
3. Run the cells step-by-step.
4. Listen to the AI-generated voice response!


## Notes

- Make sure to add your API key for Cohere if required.
- Supported languages depend on Whisper and gTTS capabilities.
- Works best with clear and short voice inputs.


## Example Use Cases

- Voice-based chatbots  
- Accessibility tools  
- Language learning assistants  
- Voice-to-voice translation experiments
